# Telegram Data Scraping and NER Project

## Overview
This project focuses on scraping Telegram e-commerce data and fine-tuning models for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Project Structure
- **task-1:** Data ingestion and preprocessing.
- **task-2:** Data labeling and preparation for NER.
- **task-3:** Model fine-tuning and evaluation.

## How to Get Started
1. Place raw data in `task-1/data/`.
2. Use `task-1/scripts/` for scraping and preprocessing.
3. Save labeled data in `task-2/data/`.
4. Fine-tune and evaluate models in `task-3/`.

## Requirements
- Python
- Telethon
- Pandas
- Hugging Face Transformers
